# Random Quote Machine
Welcome to my Random Quote Machine!
<br /> This is a project made for study purposes and may be useful to those who are looking for a open-source randomizer.
<br /> In order to make this, i chose 10 quotes from random author. The application already loads a random quote when first opened, along with the original author of the phrase. When you click on "New quote!" button, it will randomly pick another quote from the array. On the bottom-left of the quote box, there is a retweet button, that will creat a Twitter post with quotation marks and followed by the author's name for you to share.
<br /> The languages used to creat this app were: HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ReactJS).

### NOTE: THIS IS A WIDESCREEN, PC-BASED PROJECT. IT MAY NOT WORK VERY WELL WITH 4:3 RESOLUTIONS/SMARTPHONE SCREENS.
