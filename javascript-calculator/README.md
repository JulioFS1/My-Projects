# JavaScript Calculator
Welcome to my JS based Calculator.
<br /> This project was created for study purposes and may be useful for those who seek for a open-source calculator.
<br /> It works as a regular calculator: clock on any number or logic operator and it will be shown on the display. Click on the results button, and your operation will be calculated. Note that this project uses Formula Logic to calc, so it may give you a different result from most common types of calculators.
<br />This application is made out of three languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript (React).

### NOTE: THIS IS A WIDESCREEN, PC-BASED PROJECT. IT MAY NOT WORK VERY WELL WITH 4:3 RESOLUTIONS/SMARTPHONE SCREENS.
