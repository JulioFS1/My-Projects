# Drum Machine
Welcome to my Drum Machine!
This project was created for study purposes and may be useful for people who seeks a open-source drum pad.
The application functionality is quite simple: press any button on the pad and it will make a differente sound, like a normal drum pad. as you will see, the pads also have letters inside, press the equivalent key on your keyboard and it will activate the corresponding button. There is a label above the padbutton which indicates what sound was played.
<br />The technologies i used for this project were: JavaScript (jQuery), CSS and HTML5. I also used sounds from the FreeCodeCamp library.

## PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A WIDESCREEN, PC-BASED PROJECT. IT MAY NOT WORK VERY WELL WITH 4:3 RESOLUTIONS/SMARTPHONE SCREENS.
