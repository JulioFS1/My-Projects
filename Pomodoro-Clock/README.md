# 25 + X Clock
## This project is a Pomodoro Style Clock
This application was created to study practices and intends to help people who works with a Pomodoro clock.
It works pretty simple: the Break Length label allows you to modify for how much time you want to pause your work. The Session Lenght label is where you can set how much time you will use for each work session. When the session timer comes to zero, you will have a break time. It is also possible to pause, unpause and reset the clock.
The current technologies present on this project are: Javascript (jQuery), CSS and HTML.
## NOTE: THIS IS A WIDESCREEN, PC BASED PROJECT. IT MAY NOT WORK VERY WELL WITH 4:3 SIZED AND SMARTPHONE SCREENS.
