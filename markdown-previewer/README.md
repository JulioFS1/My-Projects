# Markdown Previewer
Welcome to my Markdown Previewer.
<br />This application works as a regular previewer. The box on the left allows you to write all you need to be marked and the box on the right will show you how it will be as a HTML text. 
<br /> In order to do that, i used CSS, HTML and JavaScript (React). Most important, the previewer is being made by the <b>markedJS</b> script. You can find the documentation and learn how to use it right here: https://github.com/markedjs/marked/blob/master/README.md.

### NOTE: THIS IS A WIDESCREEN, PC-BASED PROJECT. IT MAY NOT WORK VERY WELL WITH 4:3 RESOLUTIONS/SMARTPHONE SCREENS.
